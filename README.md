## BSc-Thesis Template

The master branch contains a template that is an advanced and modern version of a template called "bachelor_oswald_template". <br />
Build with PDFLaTeX<br /> <br /> 

* In fact, the only thing left from that old template are writing tips & hints in various sections located in "main.tex". <br />  Latex code changed completely. <br /> <br /> 
* Scripts for automating the bibliography records sponsored by IAIK Institute - Graz University of Technology. <br /> 
* I slightly changed the automation scripting. Execute "get_dblp.sh" to automatically gather references from the dblp database 
(dblp.uni-trier.de) and add it to your bibliography.<br /> <br /> 

For more information on how to use this template see the Introduction Section!<br />
