This template is an advanced and modern version of a template called "bachelor_oswald_template". <br /> <br /> 
In fact, the only thing left from that old template are writing tips & hints in various sections located in "main.tex". <br />  Latex code changed completely. <br /> <br /> 
Scripts for automating the bibliography are from a guy (I don't know) at the IAIK Institute - Graz University of Technology. <br /> 
I slightly changed them. Install Python3 and run "get_dblp.sh" to automatically gather references from the dblp database 
(dblp.uni-trier.de) and add it to your bibliography.<br /> <br /> 

For more information on how to use this template see the Introduction Section!
