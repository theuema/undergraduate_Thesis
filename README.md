This template is an advanced and modern version of a template called "bachelor_oswald_template".
In fact, the only thing that is left from this template are writing tips & hints in various sections located in "main.tex". Latex code changed completely. 
Scripts for automating the bibliography are from a guy (I don't know) at the IAIK Institute - Graz University of Technology. 
I slightly changed them. Install Python3 and run "get_dblp.sh" to automatically gather references from the dblp database 
(dblp.uni-trier.de) and add it to your bibliography.

For more information on how to use this template see the Introduction Section!
